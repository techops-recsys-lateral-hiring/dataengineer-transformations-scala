# Data transformations with Scala

This is a collection of jobs that are supposed to transform data.
These jobs are using _Spark_ to process larger volumes of data and are supposed to run on a _Spark_ cluster (
via `spark-submit`).

## Gearing Up for the Pairing Session

**‚úÖ Goals**

1. **Get a working environment**  
   Either local ([local](#local-setup), or using [gitpod](#gitpod-setup))
2. **Get a high-level understanding of the code and test dataset structure**
3. Have your preferred text editor or IDE setup and ready to go.

**‚ùå Non-Goals**

- solving the exercises / writing code
  > ‚ö†Ô∏è The exercises will be given at the time of interview, and solved by pairing with the interviewer.

## Pre-requisites

Please make sure you have the following installed

* Java 11
* Scala 2.12.16
* Sbt 1.7.x
* Apache Spark 3.3 with ability to run spark-submit

## Local Setup Process

* Clone the repo
* Package the project with `sbt package`
* Ensure that you're able to run the tests with `sbt test` (some are ignored)
* Sample data is available in the `src/test/resource/data` directory

> üí° If you don't manage to run the local setup or you have restrictions to install software in your laptop, use
> the [gitpod](#gitpod-setup) one

### Gitpod setup

Alternatively, you can setup the environment using

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/techops-recsys-lateral-hiring/dataengineer-transformations-scala)

There's an initialize script setup that takes around 3 minutes to complete. Once you use paste this repository link in
new Workspace, please wait until the packages are installed.
After everything is setup, select Poetry's environment by clicking on thumbs up icon and navigate to Testing tab and hit
refresh icon to discover tests.

Note that you can use gitpod's web interface or
setup [ssh to Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode#connecting-to-vs-code-desktop) so
that you can use VS Code from local to remote to Gitpod

Remember to stop the vm and restart it just before the interview.

### Verify setup

> All of the following commands should be running successfully

#### Run all tests

```bash
sbt test
```

#### Run specific tests class

```bash
sbt "test:testOnly *MySuite"
```

#### Run style checks

```bash
sbt scalastyle
```

# STOP HERE: Do not code before the interview begins.

## Jobs

There are two applications in this repo: Word Count, and Citibike.

Currently these exist as skeletons, and have some initial test cases which are defined but ignored. For each
application, please un-ignore the tests and implement the missing logic.

## Wordcount

A NLP model is dependent on a specific input file. This job is supposed to preprocess a given text file to produce this
input file for the NLP model (feature engineering). This job will count the occurrences of a word within the given text
file (corpus).

There is a dump of the data lake for this under `test/resources/data/words.txt` with a text file.

#### Input

Simple `*.txt` file containing text.

#### Output

A single `*.csv` file containing data similar to:

```csv
"word","count"
"a","3"
"an","5"
...
```

#### Run the job

```bash
 spark-submit --master local --class thoughtworks.wordcount.WordCount \
    target/scala-2.12/tw-pipeline_2.12-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
    "./src/main/resources/data/words.txt" \
    ./output
```

### Citibike

For analytics purposes the BI department of a bike share company would like to present dashboards, displaying the
distance each bike was driven. There is a `*.csv` file that contains historical data of previous bike rides. This input
file needs to be processed in multiple steps. There is a pipeline running these jobs.

![citibike pipeline](docs/citibike.png)

There is a dump of the datalake for this under `/src/test/resources/data/citibike.csv` with historical data.

#### Ingest

Reads a `*.csv` file and transforms it to parquet format. The column names will be sanitized (whitespaces replaced).

##### Input

Historical bike ride `*.csv` file:

```csv
"tripduration","starttime","stoptime","start station id","start station name","start station latitude",...
364,"2017-07-01 00:00:00","2017-07-01 00:06:05",539,"Metropolitan Ave & Bedford Ave",40.71534825,...
...
```

##### Output

`*.parquet` files containing the same content

```csv
"tripduration","starttime","stoptime","start_station_id","start_station_name","start_station_latitude",...
364,"2017-07-01 00:00:00","2017-07-01 00:06:05",539,"Metropolitan Ave & Bedford Ave",40.71534825,...
...
```

##### Run the job

```bash
spark-submit --master local --class thoughtworks.ingest.DailyDriver \
    target/scala-2.12/tw-pipeline_2.12-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
    "./src/main/resources/data/citibike.csv" \
    "./output_int"
```

#### Distance calculation

This job takes bike trip information and calculates the "as the crow flies" distance traveled for each trip. It reads
the previously ingested data parquet files.

Hint:

- For distance calculation, consider using [**Harvesine formula**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) as
  an option.

##### Input

Historical bike ride `*.parquet` files

```csv
"tripduration",...
364,...
...
```

##### Outputs

`*.parquet` files containing historical data with distance column containing the calculated distance.

```csv
"tripduration",...,"distance"
364,...,1.34
...
```

##### Run the job

```bash
 spark-submit --master local --class thoughtworks.citibike.CitibikeTransformer \
    target/scala-2.12/tw-pipeline_2.12-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
    "./output_int" \
    ./output
```
